<p>Dear Real Estate Agent:</p>

<p>I understand that you may be working at a real estate brokerage or on a traditional team as part of someone else’s personal brand. You understand your potential and are working hard to clear a path toward your goals, but currently lack the support you need to achieve them. </p>

<p>Many brokerages promise to provide structure, coaching, and other resources, but fail to make good on their word once they’ve drawn you in. As a result of this and other factors, <strong>82% of all new agents fail within five years of working in the industry.</strong></p>

<p>The reason so many agents drop out of the business is simple: They don’t know what they’re doing. And this often isn’t their fault. It’s an unfortunate truth of our industry that the majority of brokerages out there don’t properly educate or equip their agents. </p>

<p>Even the most hardworking agent won’t get anywhere if they aren’t headed in the right direction. </p>

<p>It’s time to stop chasing dead ends. It’s time to forge your own path to success.</p>

<p><strong>My name is Jason Bramblett. I’m the broker-owner of Jason Bramblett Real Estate and I’ve got an offer for you.</strong> Having worked in real estate for more than 20 years myself, I’ve seen a lot of people in the same position you’re in right now. </p>

<p>I’ve seen people rack up tens of thousands of dollars in credit card debt, waste time and money on useless activities, and even begin lying to their spouses as a result of their failed attempts to succeed in real estate. These people lay awake at night wondering if entering the industry was a mistake—questioning whether they should just cut their losses and fall back into a regular 9-to-5 job. They’ve simply lost hope.</p>

<p><strong>If this sounds familiar, then consider this message your lifeline.</strong> </p>

<p>I’ve personally trained more than hundreds of agents just like you—I’ve taken people struggling to stay afloat in life, let alone their business, and turned them into top-producing real estate professionals, and I can do the same for you. </p>

<p>Agents selling in an average price point in our area will make just $25,000 in a year if they sell one home a month. And, as you know, selling even just one home takes a lot of work. In other words, the majority of agents are not only wasting their time, but they’re also wasting their money and energy. Going to school, getting your license, and working hard just isn’t enough to make it. </p>

<p>I know this because I’ve been in your shoes. I’ve been in the same rut you find yourself in now, and I know what it takes to get out: <strong>You’ve got to become a shark.</strong></p>

<p>Let me explain what I mean.</p>

<p>Many agents out there simply wait for success to come to them. <strong>They wait for leads like a goldfish waiting for food to be dropped into its bowl.</strong> </p>

<p>If you want to thrive in real estate, you need to be a shark. You need to hunt for what you want and grab it when you find it. You can’t be passive. </p>

<p>With that said, we don’t expect you to have all the answers. We want to set you up with the tools you need to “be a shark.” In addition to my personal experience in the industry, <strong>I have leveraged my exposure to various other brokerages and top vendors to create training resources that teach agents like you everything you need to know to succeed.</strong> </p>

<p>Better still, we don’t ask you to pay for training up front like many other brokerages do. Instead, we allow you to invest a portion of your commission as you go. Our training scales up depending on your personal needs and is available 24/7 through our video library. </p>

<p>Not only is this video library available for reference, but it also serves as a training and accountability tool for our agents. We monitor who logs into the cloud-based system we host it on and also quiz our agents over the information to make sure they’ve fully absorbed it. We don’t leave you to struggle on your own like most brokerages do. </p>

<p>Our systems truly work, but don’t just take my word for it. Consider the story of one of our team’s top agents: Yamil Martinez. </p>

<p>Yamil immigrated from Venezuela, bringing with him a drive to succeed. Before coming to us, he got his start as a salesperson for Rent-a-Center. His sales volume at the time exceeded $600,000, yet he was only making approximately $38,000 a year. Despite not making nearly what he deserved, Yamil was able to save up enough money for a down payment. That was when he met us. His experience of buying a home with us was so incredible that he decided it was time for him to get involved in the industry, too. He got his license, we put him through training, and now, four years later, he is one of our top agents.</p>

<p>Yamil’s success story is incredible, and now it’s time for you to start writing your own. </p>

<p>After all, the choice is in your hands. You can stay struggling where you’re at, join a big box brokerage where you’ll get no support, or even quit the industry altogether and go get started working at a 9-to-5 job—or you can join Jason Bramblett Real Estate and start leading the life you deserve. </p>

<p>Our support-oriented environment helps professionals learn, grow, and thrive. <strong>People join us because they want to succeed, make money, and serve our community.</strong> We understand that to reach those goals, you need support, coaching, resources, and leads—so that is exactly what we provide. </p>

<p>So what are you waiting for? It’s time to take control of your future and see firsthand how joining us can transform your life and career. The longer you wait to reach out, the longer you’re suppressing your true potential. Let’s have a conversation. </p>

<p>I look forward to talking to you soon!</p>

<p>Jason Bramblett</p>

<h1 class="join-us">Free Real Estate Business Planning Call</h1>
<h5 class="join-us-subtitle">Are you a hungry real estate agent looking for more?</h5>

<p>Dear Fellow Agent:</p>

<p>Need direction and focus to sell more homes?</p>

<p>I’ll meet with you one-on-one to help you write a business plan you can implement immediately to generate leads, appointments, and sales.</p>

<p><strong>I know how challenging it is to sell real estate.</strong></p>

<p>You have discount brokerages, competing agents, and hundreds of ways to get clients (I can assure you, all are not equal).</p>

<p>It can get overwhelming to stick to a consistent business plan that makes you money.</p>

<p>My name is Jason Bramblett and we’ve sold thousands of homes.</p>

<p>I want to help you sell more homes.</p>

<p>I’ll learn about your needs, goals, and why you started selling real estate. I’m happy to offer my insight on what I would do in your situation to sell more homes.</p>

<p>I will also share with you what we’re doing that works to generate leads and sales.</p>

<p>Once I understand how you like to do business that’s authentic to you (referral, prospecting, marketing, events, etc), I’ll help you write a business plan tailored just for you.</p>

<p>You’ll walk away with a plan of action, with steps you can take right away, to find homeowners who will list their home with you.</p>

<p>This will help you get the commission consistency and the freedom we all want from our business.</p>

<p class="section-title">Here’s what a few agents say about working with me…</p>

<p><span class="quote">Training is very practical and interactive and it is presented in a variety of ways to enhance retention of the information and skills shared.</span><br>
<span class="author">- Elisabeth Corona</span></p>

<p><span class="quote">Our team does really well in the area of growth rather than criticism. It's this atmosphere of growth that gives our team members the willingness to fail and share areas of weakness in their personal pursuits to success.<br><br>

I've enjoyed learning from real experiences that are happening in our current day. It's helpful to know the objections agents are being faced with today and what to expect from our specific demographic. I appreciate that our training isn't only coming from books and studies, but that it's based off the experiences that our specific team brings in, complemented by books and studies that offer insight and wisdom from individuals who have been where we are and have built strategic systems to grow their own personal success. I appreciate that our team has taken the opportunity to learn from others failures and have chosen to walk in wisdom rather than recreating history with no consideration to learn from others.<br><br>

"No need to recreate the wheel."

<p><span class="quote">We train like black ops, trained by the best in the industry, with a specifically designed & proven training program to maximize the natural skills of anyone who is highly motivated to make Real Estate a successful and rewarding Career.
"we are no here to take part, we are here to take over"</span><br>
<span class="author">- Yamil Martinez</span></p>

<p><span class="quote">To a NEW agent - Real Estate is a career in which "you don't know what you don't know." Working here is a continuous learning process and it's almost my 2 year anniversary! That said, everyone on the team is always willing to stop what they are doing and help advise/teach when you aren't sure. For example - I specifically remember when I was putting my first OTP together and it was almost midnight. I was excited, so didn't want to wait till the next day. Yamil was willing to get out of bed to help walk me through what to do over the phone.</span><br>

<p><span class="quote">I've been a part of many sales teams in my 40+ year sales career, even leading several teams as well. No one has come close to the level and quality of sales training that Jason provides. Training is constant, fluid, and timely, always mirroring the current economic market. Our training includes how to handle buyer and seller objections, what to expect and look for in market upturns and downturns, as well as making sure all agents are up to speed with the new technologies coming onto the market. Great training results in great sales success! Thank you Jason!</span><br>

<p>You don’t need to pay a bunch of money to a real estate coach.</p>

<p>Why am I offering this?</p>

<p>I’ll help you for free in return that maybe, over the long term – and only if it makes sense - you’d like to learn more about working at our brokerage.</p>

<p>Let me be clear that is not the intent of the meeting. That’s another conversation for another time and only if you have any interest.</p>

<p>I also figure we’ll do business together someday and I would like to get to know you. I enjoy seeing real estate agents succeed. It’s fulfilling, and I love it.</p>

<p><strong>I invite you to request a free one-on-one business strategy meeting with me.</strong> We can meet for coffee, or even if it’s more convenient, a phone call or a video conference works, too.</p>

<p>I have a questionnaire I would like you to fill out so that when we meet so I’m prepared to offer you specific advice. When you request a call, I’ll email it to you to complete before the meeting.</p>

<p>Look forward to meeting with you. Let’s grow your business.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Jason Bramblett</p>

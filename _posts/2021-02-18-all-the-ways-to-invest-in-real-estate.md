I’m back to answer yet another stellar question from an awesome viewer out there. Today’s question is, **“Is there a way that someone can get involved in real estate investing without owning a physical property and having to deal with all the hassle?”**

The answer is, “Absolutely yes\!” There are so many different ways to participate. You could turn your first home into an investment property when you’re ready to buy another, but that’s not the only way to get involved. **Land is a great investment,** and you can make a lot of money leasing dirt. Dirt doesn’t talk back, it doesn’t give you any issues, it doesn’t break down, and it doesn’t require a huge investment upfront.&nbsp;

McDonald’s business model is a great example of how potent this investment strategy can be. The corporation itself owns most of the land upon which the franchisees have their restaurants. This was a stroke of genius and it’s the reason McDonald’s is worth billions today.

In our area, we also see a lot of farmers who lease the ground where other farmers grow their crops. This is another great long-term play because if you don’t do anything with land, stuff grows. **Leasing it helps preserve that stuff from growing and devaluing your land.**

Hunting leases have become very popular as well. Plenty of people want to hunt but don’t own the property, so they pay a fee to the landowner for the privilege to hunt on it. This is a great investment, especially in the Midwest.

As you can see, investing in real estate isn’t just limited to buying and selling homes. If you have any questions about the different ways you can use real estate to build wealth, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

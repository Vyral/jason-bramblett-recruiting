<p>Our goal is to give you a taste of the training we provide if you have any interest in working with us in the future.</p>

<p><strong>We have no intention of recruiting you</strong> - that’s a conversation with us when you are ready, if at all.</p>

<p>Last year 21,452 homes sold in the greater Triad market.</p>

<p>That’s plenty of business to go around for all of us.</p>

<p>The same training they get will help you do it as well.</p>

<p><strong>Here’s what a few agents say about our free training:</strong></p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">“Training is very practical and interactive and it is presented in a variety of ways to enhance retention of the information and skills shared.” <span class="testimonial-author">- Elisabeth Corona</span></p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">“Our team does really well in the area of growth rather than criticism. It's this atmosphere of growth that gives our team members the willingness to fail and share areas of weakness in their personal pursuits to success. I've enjoyed learning from real experiences that are happening in our current day. It's helpful to know the objections agents are being faced with today and what to expect from our specific demographic. I appreciate that our training isn't only coming from books and studies, but that it's based off the experiences that our specific team brings in, complemented by books and studies that offer insight and wisdom from individuals who have been where we are and have built strategic systems to grow their own personal success. I appreciate that our team has taken the opportunity to learn from others failures and have chosen to walk in wisdom rather than recreating history with no consideration to learn from others. No need to recreate the wheel.” <span class="testimonial-author">- Kayla Suddreth</span></p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">“We train like black ops, trained by the best in the industry, with a specifically designed & proven training program to maximize the natural skills of anyone who is highly motivated to make Real Estate a successful and rewarding Career. We are not here to take part, we are here to take over” <span class="testimonial-author">- Yamil Martinez</span></p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">“To a NEW agent - Real Estate is a career in which "you don't know what you don't know." Working here is a continuous learning process and it's almost my 2 year anniversary! That said, everyone on the team is always willing to stop what they are doing and help advise/teach when you aren't sure. For example - I specifically remember when I was putting my first OTP together and it was almost midnight. I was excited, so didn't want to wait till the next day. Yamil was willing to get out of bed to help walk me through what to do over the phone.” <span class="testimonial-author">- Amber Johnson</span></p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">“I've been a part of many sales teams in my 40+ year sales career, even leading several teams as well. No one has come close to the level and quality of sales training that Jason provides. Training is constant, fluid, and timely, always mirroring the current economic market. Our training includes how to handle buyer and seller objections, what to expect and look for in market upturns and downturns, as well as making sure all agents are up to speed with the new technologies coming onto the market. Great training results in great sales success! Thank you Jason!” <span class="testimonial-author">- Bruce Thomas, Buyer Specialist</span></p>
